# Elevate-Labs_Task3

#### Overview

This project demonstrates SQL-based data analysis on the Brazilian E-commerce Public Dataset by Olist, available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).
The goal is to extract meaningful insights, such as top product categories, payment trends, freight costs, and delivery times, while demonstrating best practices in SQL query design and performance optimization.

#### Dataset Description

The dataset includes multiple CSV files, each representing a table in the database:

* olist_orders_dataset.csv: Order details (order ID, customer ID, status, timestamps).
* olist_order_items_dataset.csv: Items in each order (order ID, product ID, price, freight value).
* olist_products_dataset.csv: Product information (product ID, category).
* olist_customers_dataset.csv: Customer details (customer ID, state).
* olist_order_payments_dataset.csv: Payment information (order ID, payment value).
